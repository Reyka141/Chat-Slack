## Description

Chat (Slack) is a simplified version of a real-time messaging application for team collaboration,
developed using React, Redux (with reduxjs/toolkit), and WebSockets for instant communication.
The project includes REST API integration, client-side routing, authentication and authorization,
and uses webpack for bundling and deployment. It is designed to demonstrate key technologies commonly used in modern frontend development.
